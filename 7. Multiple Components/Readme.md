# 7. Multiple components

One of the most important feature of react is to re-use code. We can do it creating multiple components and combining them. Thanks to that, we can build a scalable application easily. 

### ⚽️ Goals:
  * Create and combine multiple components.

### 💻 Steps: 

  * Continue from the previous project...
  * Create a `Navbar` component and add it on `App` component. ([Bootstrap Navbar example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/#containers))
  * Create a `Person` component. 
    * Should receive a `name` and `age` by props.
    * Fill your info as a default prop.
  * Add those components on `App` component.
  * Check everything is working fine!
