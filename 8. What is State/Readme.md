# 8. What is State

We use **state** to store data in a component. Those data is mutable, so you can manage those data on his component and pass it to your childs as a props. If this data changes, will fire the render method of his childs.

Let's see this in action!

### ⚽️ Goals:

  * Check everything is working fine!

    * Add a button to increase the `age`.
